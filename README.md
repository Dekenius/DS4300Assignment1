# DS4300 Assignment 1
Contributors: Griffin Milas, Dan Krasnonosenkikh, Matthew Wojtowicz

Assumptions: 
* Users are followed and follow other users randomly. 
* Tweets are assigned to users randomly. 
* Dates are assigned via the formula (current date - random long).  
* Users cannot follow themself
* Size of tweet is at max 100 characters.

We assume that by assigning followers and tweets randomly instead of biasing, tweets and followers will be distributed fairly evenly amongst users, resulting in better performance than if they were biased.
